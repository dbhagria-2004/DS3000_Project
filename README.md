# Stock Price Modeling with Regression (DS3000)

## Overview
This repository contains a **class project** completed for **DS3000: Foundations of Data Science**.  
The project explores how regression-based models can be used to explain **daily stock closing prices** using publicly available market data.

The emphasis of this project is on developing a **mathematical understanding of regression**, including Ordinary Least Squares, the normal equation, polynomial feature expansion, and residual-based model diagnostics.

---

## Project Goals
- Implement linear regression **from scratch using NumPy**
- Understand the **normal equation** for Ordinary Least Squares
- Explore **polynomial features and interaction terms**
- Evaluate model behavior using **MSE, R², and residual plots**

---

## Data
Daily historical stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** was collected using Yahoo Finance.  
The **closing price** is used as the response variable.

---

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression (OLS)
- Polynomial Regression (degree 4)
- Polynomial Regression with interaction terms  

All models use a **time-ordered 70–30 train-test split** to avoid data leakage.

## Notes
This project was completed **as part of a course assignment** and is intended for educational purposes only.  
It does **not** attempt to forecast future stock prices or provide financial advice.
